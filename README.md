# UFOs
JavaScript, Bootstrap, and UFOs

## Resources
- Datasets:
  - USA sightings

- Software:
  - JavaScript
  - D3 library
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Bootstrap

## Overview 
The goal was to have UFO data displayed in an organized table.  With the ability to filter on multiple identifiers: date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO.  The table was created using JavaScript and displayed via a HTML file.

- The website displays a structured table with UFO sighting details, including additional comments. 
- The website was designed using JavaScript and HTML and decorated using CSS and Bootstrap.
- The website is intuitive to use.

## Summary
The data set is presented as intended and looks great with the tools used display the HTML page.  The data only considers USA UFO sightings, so it is good for researchers looking specifically for US data.  We do know the phenomenon is recognized worldwide so it is limited in this capacity.  If the data set was to be expanded it would bring in more researchers and potentially identify same shapes on same days around the world.  The best update to the data set would be adding recently released sightings by US military.  The data set could then stay USA focused but bring in latest data from the government to help researchers identify frequency and dangers of UFOs near military operations.
